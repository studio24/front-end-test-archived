# Front-End Implementation Test

## Instructions

Please build the components into well-formed HTML/CSS paying particular attention to matching the supplied web design in *Mobile.png* and *Desktop.png* as well as you see fit. Pay special attention to colour, spacing and type. 

Please build one responsive web page and make your own judgement on how the components should change in-between the two illustrated breakpoints. Do not use any third-party libraries, frameworks or themes for this work. There is no requirement for JavaScript interaction, HTML and CSS will suffice. 

Please supply this as a single HTML page with associated files (e.g. CSS, images). We will test this by viewing the web page via a URL on http://localhost to ensure the web fonts load.

It is expected this test will take around 3-4 hours to complete.
